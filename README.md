## Abstract
In recent years, with the increasing popularity of “Smart Technology”, the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and systems have surged significantly. Various IoT services and functionalities are based on the analytics of IoT streaming data. However, IoT data analytics faces concept drift challenges due to the dynamic nature of IoT systems and the ever-changing patterns of IoT data streams. In this article, we propose an adaptive IoT streaming data analytics framework for anomaly detection use cases based on optimized LightGBM and concept drift adaptation. A novel drift adaptation method named Optimized Adaptive and Sliding Windowing (OASW) is proposed to adapt to the pattern changes of online IoT data streams. Experiments on two public datasets show the high accuracy and efficiency of our proposed adaptive LightGBM model compared against other state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed adaptive LightGBM model can perform continuous learning and drift adaptation on IoT data streams without human intervention.

## Implementation 
### Dataset 
NSL-KDD dataset, a popular network traffic dataset for intrusion detection problems
* Publicly available at: [[1]](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html) [[2]](https://github.com/jmnwong/NSL-KDD-Dataset)   

### Code  
There are four folders: NSL-KDD, IoT ID 20, Edge IIoT dataset, XGB with NSL-KDD data. 
* NSL-KDD and IoT ID 20 is the reproduction of experiments presented in paper.
* Edge IIoT dataset contains replication of experiment with Edge IIoT dataset.
* XGB with NSL-KDD data is replication using XGB ML model instead of Light GBM.

Files in every folders are like these

* Dataset pre-processing  
* Static machine learning algorithm development
* Proposed OASW drift detection method implementation

I didn't reproduce real time prediction which is available in original repository because this uses py QT visualization which is not possible on Google Colab and while running on my machine it gets stuck and not responding.
